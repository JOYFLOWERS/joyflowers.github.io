# Unit 3 Reflections

This last unit consisted of Secure Scripting, GUI Automation, Web Scraping and the Hackathon Final Project. I especially enjoyed the GUI Automation section and the Final Project.

Secure Scripting was interesting and useful but Iâ€™ve done this type of coding before, so it was not new. The GUI Automation was somewhat new to me, and I enjoyed how robust it was. I was able to capture part of a screen to automate a game called Sushi-go-round, but the assignment I completed was to automatically complete a form, using Python to populate and tab from one text field to another. This was easy to do through built-in Python functions. I enjoyed learning Web Scraping, yet most of the examples in the book did not work; I believe it is because I was using a Mac. There were several issues logged on the Internet regarding this. I was able to finally work with Beautiful Soup. I tried to grab a price from Amazon as shown in the book, but I believe I was blocked, as I was able to go to other web sites using the same logic and successfully get other data such as temperature from weather.com. 

I took Python because of my interest in Data Science. For my final project I chose to use Python with machine learning to identify indicators of chronic kidney disease. The reason I chose this is because, while working in health benefits, I noticed that end-stage renal disease (which is the last stage of chronic kidney disease) was a major cost of healthcare. Therefore, if indicators and root causes for kidney disease can be identified, prevention is possibile. If kidney disease is prevented, not only are people healthier and have a greater quality of life, but also healthcare costs overall, can decrease significantly.

It is amazing that Python can be used in so many areas. It seems to be such a versatile language and gives the programmer the ability to easily do great works.
