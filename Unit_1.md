# Unit 1 Reflection Page

This page simply reflects upon the projects completed and the concepts learned in the first few weeks of the Python course. 

The main projects completed in this unit were:
•	Password Manager project that allows a user to enter and retrieve passwords for certain websites and services. It encrypts and decrypts the passwords, copies to the clipboard and launches the website upon request. It uses a dictionary structure to capture username, master passphrase, service (such as Amazon, eBay, Expedia…), url and password. It will also automatically generate a secure password, upon request.
•	The Encryption project was a prerequisite to the Password Manager project. It demonstrated various encryption and decryption methodologies.
•	The Password Generator project simply generates a password using four random words that are modified using numbers in place of certain letters. It is also a prerequisite to the Password Manager system.
•	In addition, many assignments have completed that have help to learn about Python, specifically addressing flow control, functions, strings, lists and dictionaries.

Of all the projects, there are none that I would remove from the collection. So far the Password Manager project is the most comprehensive weekly project and the one I am most proud of. It was the most challenging. However, there are enhancements that could still be made to it. For example, it does not write the dictionary out to a file so only what is in memory at the time is active, and that would be the next enhancement. It also could be enhanced to allow for multiple users. It could also be enhanced so it has a graphical user interface. 

The Password Manager has a real-world application as there are many Password Manager programs sold to and used by IT departments for the security of their employees and software systems. These Password Manager systems can also be used by individuals as long as they are made to be secure. 

I do feel that this reflects my abilities but it is a work in process. I would not typically publish this work prior to a fully complete system, but in this case, the objective in this course is not to continue with a full-scale Password Manager system. If this were the objective, I would publish it when it was fully enhanced, but instead the course will move us in new directions and focus on other aspects of Python.
