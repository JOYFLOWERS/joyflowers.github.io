Things I have learned in Python so far.

In Python one can create dictionaries, lists and strings and manipulate each of these.

Using an input statement, one can prompt a user for information and use that information to control code.

There are some key words for flow control such as 'if','while', and 'for' statements.

Some differences between Python and other languages are that in Python, you do not have to end procedures.
The indentations take care of that. Also, in Python, one does not have to declare a data type such as integer.
Python figures out the assignment of it.
