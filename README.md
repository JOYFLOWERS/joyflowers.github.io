## About Me
I had been an Information Systems professional for 35 years and just retired in June 2019. I worked in manufacturing, mortgage lending, healthcare, education, and government doing jobs such as computer programming, teaching, analytics, project management, consulting as well as serving in management capacities. I have been married for 35 years and have a daughter who teaches elementary school in Sacramento. I have lived in Stockton, California for more than 40 years.
## College Experience
Many years ago, I received a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a Minor in Mathematics. Shortly after that, I received certification in Electronics Technology. I then received an Associates degree in Ministerial Studies. After that I received my MBA and then certification in Data Science from John Hopkins University. I have continued to take college courses throughout my life. For the past five years, I have been enjoying taking data science courses. The last course I completed was Machine Learning from Coursera/Stanford.
## Computer Experience
The majority of my computer experience was in either developing or implementing comprehensive enterprise-wide systems for large companies.
## This Class - Python
I have had several courses that require me to program using Python, so I have learned it on-the-fly, so thought now I would take the course from the beginning. I am also looking forward to meeting like-minded students in this class.
## Obstacles
I intend to do well in this class, so nothing is a real obstacle right now, but I do commute from Stockton and I am taking a 15-day cruise during the span of this course. These will be challenges that I intend to overcome.
## Greatest Priority
My absolute greatest priority is my **family**. I have spent the past couple of months visiting most of my extended family members. Aside from that, my next priority is to see if I can contribute to the field of data science/artificial intelligence/robotics.
## Interests
Outside of the above, my husband and I love to be outdoors. We enjoy light hiking (as I have an ankle injury) and kayaking. In my earlier years, I enjoyed a lot of sports in- and outside of school which include volleyball, track, dancing, gymnastics, swimming, figure skating, tennis and badminton.
