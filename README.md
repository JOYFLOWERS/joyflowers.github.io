I have been married for 35 years and have a daughter who teaches elementary school in Sacramento. I have lived in Stockton, California for more than 40 years.
## College Experience
Many years ago, I received a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a Minor in Mathematics. Shortly after that, I received certification in Electronics Technology. I then received a Associates degree in Ministerial Studies. After that I received my MBA and then certification in Data Science from John Hopkins University. I have continued to take college courses throughout my life.
